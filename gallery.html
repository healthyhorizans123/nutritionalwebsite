                  <div class="text">The image is a world map showing the share of the population that was undernourished in 2020, based on data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The map uses a color gradient to indicate the percentage of undernourished individuals in each country, with darker shades of red representing higher levels of undernourishment (above 40%) and lighter shades indicating lower percentages (around 5%). It highlights severe food insecurity in parts of Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, while many developed regions such as North America and Europe either have low levels of undernourishment or lack available data. The map underscores global disparities in food security and nutrition</div>

                  <div class="text">“Be stronger than your excuses” is a motivational phrase that encourages individuals to overcome the barriers and justifications they often create for not pursuing their goals. It reminds us that we can choose discipline and perseverance over the comfort of excuses. Essentially, it’s a call to action to prioritize personal strength and determination, rather than letting reasons or rationalizations hold us back.</div>
